I want to add one more tab after dashboard tab with title "Diagnostics". This tab should have a search box for entering VIN number. If matching vin number is found and selected by user, the screen should display six sections 
- First section should display the system information with values - "OS Name", "OS Version", "Hardware arch", "RAM", "Storage" 
- second section should display the entities present in the vehicle fetched using rest api. The entities can be categorised in 4 categories. Valid categories are "Area", "Components", "Apps", "Functions". 
- third section should display three live graphs for "cpu usage", "memory usage", "network usage" whose values fetched using rest api
- fourth section should display the data parameters of vehicle fetched using rest api in a table with four columns - "name", "entity", "value", "unit".
- fifth section should display the faults of vehicle fetched using rest api in a table with four columns - "entity", "code", "description", "status".
- sixth section should display the applications running in the vehicle fetched using rest api in a table with six columns - "name", "tag", "creation date", "size", "status", "action"
